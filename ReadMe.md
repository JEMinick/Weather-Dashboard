A weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  It uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.

This app will allow the user to enter the name of a city (either by "city" name only or "city, state") in the search field to locate current weather information.  Information provided by this app will include temperature, humidity, UV index and an icon picture depicting the weather.  Additionally, a 5-day forecast for the city is displayed below the current conditions showing the weather forecast for the following five days.

A history of city searches will be displayed allowing the user to easily click on a button to update the display with the associated city weather information.

A "Clear History" button is also provided allowing the user to re-start city weather search information with a simple click.
